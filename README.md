# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is the first project from 'The Odin Project'

## The Task

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The aim is to use basic HTML tags such

//<strong>, <em>, <i>, as well as ordered, <ol> and unordered, <ul>, lists.//

## The Outcome

I found this project quite easy and was able to utilise some more tags that were not necessarily emphasized within the lessons.

I mostly enjoyed remembering recipes that I have previously enjoyed and figuring our ways that I could present them nicely through HTML. :)

## Follow Up

I would really like to come back to this project once I have learned CSS and JavaScript and will note to do so once I have built a little more comfort around those subjects.
