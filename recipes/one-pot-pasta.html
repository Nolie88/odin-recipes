    <p>
      This is a beefy pasta cooked with Italian seasonings in a creamy tomato
      sauce. <br />
      Epitome of homemade comfort food with the convenience of one-pot cooking!
      <br />
      Love how the pasta absorbs the flavour of the sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients`</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>500g beef mince / ground beef</li>
      <li>2 tsp Italian herbs</li>
      <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
      <li>400g can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>4 cups (1 L) chicken stock / broth</li>
      <li>350g fusilly, penne or elbow macaronic</li>
      <li>3/4 cup thicken/heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Sauté –</strong> Heat the oil on high heat in a large
        heavy-based pot. Cook garlic and onion for 1 1/2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook beef & seasonings –</strong> Add beef and cook, breaking it
        up as you go, until you can no longer see red meat. Add the Italian
        herbs and cook for 30 seconds, then add tomato paste and cook for 1
        minute to cook out the raw flavour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>All in –</strong> Add crushed tomato, chicken stock, salt,
        pepper and red pepper flakes, if using. Stir, then add the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook 15 min –</strong> Bring the liquid to a simmer, then cook
        for 15 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes then more frequently
        towards the end (ensure pasta doesn't stick to base) until the pasta is
        just about cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Creamy –</strong> Add cream, then simmer for a further 1 to 2
        minutes. It will still be quite saucy – this is what you want! Pasta
        absorbs liquid quickly, so it will still be nice and oozy when you start
        eating.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve –</strong> Remove from the stove. Give it a good stir then
        ladle into bowls. Serve with parmesan and parsley.
      </li>
