      No false promises here – these are seriously crispy Baked Buffalo Wings
      that <br />
      are made entirely in the oven! Using a now-world-famous Cooks’ Illustrated
      <br />technique, the skin is so shatteringly crispy it’s hard to believe
      they aren’t fried.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>CRISPY BAKED WINGS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Dry overnight (optional) –</strong> If you plan ahead, lay the
        wings on a rack on a rimmed baking tray and let them dry uncovered in
        the fridge overnight. Alternatively, pat them dry with paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        P<strong>reheat</strong> the oven to 250°F/120°C (all oven types). Put
        one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top
        quarter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Line the tray</strong> with foil. Put a rack on the tray then
        spray the rack with oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toss wings – </strong>Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle
        over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock
        bag) to coat wings evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake 30 minutes on low temp –</strong> Place the wings skin side
        up on the rack (ok if snug, they shrink). Bake on the lower shelf in the
        oven for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake 40 minutes on high –</strong> Move the tray up to the
        higher shelf and turn the oven up to 425°F / 220°C (all oven types).
        Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through.
        The wings do not need to be turned over. They are ready when dark golden
        brown and the skin is very crispy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Toss in sauce –</strong> Transfer the wings into a large bowl.
        Pour over sauce and toss to coat. (Alternatively, serve wings plain with
        Buffalo Sauce for dipping).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve</strong> immediately with Blue Cheese Dip
        <i> (for both wings and celery sticks dunking) </i>!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>BUFFALO SAUCE</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together the Sauce ingredients until the sugar is melted. Keep
        warm or reheat just prior to using.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>BLUE CHEESE DIP</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mash the blue cheese with sour cream until smooth (or to your taste).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining ingredients and mix well until combined, using milk to get
        it to the consistency you want. Store in the fridge until required.
        Remove from the fridge 15 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
